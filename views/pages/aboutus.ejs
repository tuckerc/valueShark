            <p class=About>My name is Jerica Mitchell and I am a software developer. I am originally from Texas. I have my
                bachelor’s degree in computer science and many of my courses focused on cybersecurity and infrastructure. I have
                worked as an IT contractor for the past 7 years. I managed client machines and ensured that they were properly
                set up, maintained, and secured. Also, I gained great insight into how both technical and non-technical users
                interact with software.
                My goal is to obtain a position as a software developer. I’m looking for a great tech company where I can be an
                asset while advancing my career. I want to make an impact and effect positive change. Finally, I am passionate
                about helping others, so I want to use my platform to create opportunities for others. In my spare time, I like
                to do lots of stuff and things.</br></br>
