    <p class=About>My name is Jerica Mitchell and I am a software developer. I am originally from Texas. I have my
        bachelor’s degree in computer science and many of my courses focused on cybersecurity and infrastructure. I have
        worked as an IT contractor for the past 7 years. I managed client machines and ensured that they were properly
        set up, maintained, and secured. Also, I gained great insight into how both technical and non-technical users
        interact with software.
        My goal is to obtain a position as a software developer. I’m looking for a great tech company where I can be an
        asset while advancing my career. I want to make an impact and effect positive change. Finally, I am passionate
        about helping others, so I want to use my platform to create opportunities for others. In my spare time, I like
        to do lots of stuff and things.</br></br>

    <p class=About>Hello, I'm Tyler and I'm a Software Developer, I have 6 year of Military Law Enforcement. My goal is
        to continue to push myself to be uncomfortable so that I can succeed. Noone has ever succeeded by being
